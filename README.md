## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8 or higher
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* A Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio.

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**
    ```bash
    # If it's a git repository:
    # git clone <repository_url>
    # cd finance_chatbot
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure your Gemini API Key:**
    * Create a directory named `.streamlit` inside the `finance_chatbot` directory if it doesn't exist.
    * Inside `.streamlit`, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    * Add your Gemini API key to `secrets.toml` like this:
        ```toml
        GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
    * **Important**: Replace `"YOUR_ACTUAL_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your real key. Add `.streamlit/secrets.toml` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid committing your key.

You have two main ways to run the application:

### 1. Directly with Streamlit (Recommended for development & Streamlit Cloud)
